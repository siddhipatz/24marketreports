PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) technology is one of the main technologies for preparing thin film materials. Physical methods are used under vacuum conditions to vaporize a material into gaseous atoms, molecules or partial ionization into ions, and pass through low-pressure gas (or plasma) process, depositing thin film materials to achieve special functions such as anti-reflection, reflection, protection, conduction, magnetic permeability, insulation, corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance, radiation protection, decoration, etc. on the surface of the substrate material. The substances used to prepare thin film materials are called PVD coating materials. Sputtering coating and vacuum evaporation coating are the two most mainstream PVD coating methods.
