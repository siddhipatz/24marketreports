The demand for green cement is anticipated to witness a spike due to its own benefits. This type of cement is known for reducing the carbon footprint by about 40-50% during its production process. The main reason for the rising uptake of green cement in growing number of construction activities is the fact that it uses less water. Additionally, it provides excellent thermal insulation and superior fire resistance, which enables structures built with green cement to withstand temperatures up to 2400F. As green cement is known to offer unmatched insulation, it also makes the building resistant to moisture, thereby offering it a good protection against corrosion as well.
