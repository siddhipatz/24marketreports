Vial cap sealing machines manufacture the seals for glass as well as plastic vials. Both glass and plastic vials are majorly used in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries. Owing to their increased usage, the demand for vial cap sealing machines is increasing. Glass has traditionally been the primary material for vial packaging products owing to its extensive thermal and chemical resistance. It offers high transparency and maintains dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Some of the major advantages of glass vials are: Provides protection from pests and micro-organisms and does not react with the chemicals packed. Heat- resistant to treatments like sanitization and pasteurization. Reusable, recyclable, and re-sealable in nature.

According to the report, one driver in the market is increasing demand from pharmaceutical industry. A vial cap sealing machine is a key equipment for the pharmaceutical industry. This is because vials are primarily used to stock medicines that are in a liquid or powder form. A single-dose vial, used for parenteral administration as an injection or an infusion, is a unit dose used for a single patient. Single-dose or single-use vials are labeled by manufacturers and do not contain antibacterial preservatives. A multi-dose vial is used for the parenteral administration of more than one dose of medication. Multi-dose vials are also labeled by the manufacturers and compulsorily contain an antibacterial preservative to prevent the growth of bacteria and microorganisms. The increase in the demand for pharmaceutical drugs has fueled the market for vial packaging, and consequently: the growth of the global vial cap sealing machines market.
