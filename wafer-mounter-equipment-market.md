Wafer mounting machine are equipment for processing wafers, which can be divided into automatic, semi-automatic and manual according to their types. Wafer mounters are a part of the wafer fabrication process. After wafer grinding is carried out, the wafer is mounted on a metal frame for film or tape to be applied to it. This process is called wafer mounting. This becomes an essential step in the overall fabrication process as the film or tape reduces particulate contamination, thereby ensuring a highly efficient semiconductor device or component. Wafer mounter to apply cutting tape to wafer backside/cutting frame and also to peel off protective tape from patterned wafer surface.
