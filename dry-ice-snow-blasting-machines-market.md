Such a unit has a relatively simple design. For the liquid CO2 supply, it is possible to either use a low-pressure CO2 tank or a CO2 cylinder or bundle of cylinders with a riser tube. Compressed air is supplied by the on-site network or a screw compressor. Electricity supply is not required. The cleaning or pretreatment is carried out in a dry, residue-free and environmentally sound manner.

The CO2 snow blasting method is used for the cleaning and pretreatment of solid surfaces. In addition, it can also be used for separation, deburring and cooling. CO2 snow blasting offers high flexibility in application and is used, amongst others, for the following impurities: particles, dusts, greases, oils, fingerprints, separating agents, face coatings, product residues, adhesive and glue deposits, polishing agent residues, anti-corrosive agents and cooling lubricants, bitumen, waxes, varnish particles and thin paint layers, gunpowder residues, fluxing agent deposits, carbon black, lime as well as germs and fungi.
